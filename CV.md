Arm Ltd
: *Caroline Concatto / Software Engineer*
"I met David when we worked together in the DevOps team. I had just joined
the company, and I was assigned to join the DevOps team. The team was moving all
its CI/CD to a new platform. It was good to work with David. I've learned about
scripts, Makefiles, CMakes and hacks with him. We reviewed each other scripts,
work and also discussed ideas. I used to help him at release time. We applied
and collected the test results for the compiler releases. David was careful to
analyse the compiler output results. He was the first in line to check and
diagnose the compiler fault and with that information, he used to assign tasks
to the compiler engineers. David was responsible to take care of the test plan
for the compiler. He suggested and implemented new tests to improve the compiler
quality and to avoid regressions. I could see him talking with compiler
engineers, team leaders and managers to understand new features added to the
compiler. When he left it took some time to replace David with a new DevOps
person because the tasks that he was doing were complex and broad."

BBC
: *Angus Bisset / Broadcast Engineering Team Leader*
"David is a highly skilled software engineer, with a calm and considered
demeanour, always able to tackle the most complicated engineering problems, even
in high pressure situations. He's a pleasure to work with and a great asset to
any team fortunate enough to have him."
