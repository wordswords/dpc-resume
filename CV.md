Alexander Bramham, Software Engineer, ITV
* "I met David when we worked together in the DevOps team. I had just joined the company, and I was assigned to join the DevOps team. The team was moving all its CI/CD to a new platform. It was good to work with David. I've learned about scripts, Makefiles, CMakes and hacks with him. We reviewed each other scripts, work and also discussed ideas. I used to help him at release time. We applied and collected the test results for the compiler releases. David was careful to analyse the compiler output results. He was the first in line to check and diagnose the compiler fault and with that information, he used to assign tasks to the compiler engineers. David was responsible to take care of the test plan for the compiler. He suggested and implemented new tests to improve the compiler quality and to avoid regressions. I could see him talking with compiler engineers, team leaders and managers to understand new features added to the compiler. When he left it took some time to replace David with a new DevOps person because the tasks that he was doing were complex and broad."
Caroline Concatto, Software Engineer, Arm Ltd
* "David is a highly skilled software engineer, with a calm and considered demeanour, always able to tackle the most complicated engineering problems, even in high pressure situations. He's a pleasure to work with and a great asset to any team fortunate enough to have him."
